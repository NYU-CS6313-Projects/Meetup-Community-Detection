# Visualization Tool for Meetup Community Detection

Luyan Dai, Siqi Deng, Hui Zhao

Meetup.com is an online social networking platform that facilitates offline group meetings. Essentially, it offers a platform where like-minded people can form communities locally, by finding and joining topic groups based on common interests, such as arts, science, politics, etc. Our goal is for social scholars to detect various Meetup communities in a network represented by node-link diagram to find out membersâ€™ interest overlap patterns. 

Our visualization adopts a node link diagram with nodes representing Meetup members and links representing their common interests. We also provide a breaking link for exploring how interests overlap patterns change when number of common interests changes; a table showing the top ten interests and a fading effect showing all the other nodes that are connected to a chosen node. 

All data comes from Meetup.com members' profiles.

A live demo can be found [here](http://nyu-cs6313-projects.github.io/Meetup-Community-Detection/index.html).

You can use the `deploy.sh` script to keep the `gh-pages` branch up-to-date.
